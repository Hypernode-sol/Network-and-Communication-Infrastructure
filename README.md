## Overview  
This repository provides the core codebase for a **Network and Communication Infrastructure** system developed by Hypernode‑sol. The main objective is to implement a scalable, maintainable, and robust network layer to support distributed nodes, message handling, heartbeat monitoring and protocol constants.  
Written in Java and designed to serve as a foundation for high‑performance, fault‑tolerant communication in a multi‑node environment.

## Features  
- Node registration and discovery via `NodeRegistry.java`  
- Network server implementation to accept and dispatch messages (`NetworkServer.java`)  
- Protocol definitions and constants defined in `ProtocolConstants.java`  
- Message handling logic in `MessageHandler.java`  
- Heartbeat monitoring for node liveness detection (`HeartbeatMonitor.java`)  
- Modular design to extend and integrate further communication protocols  

## Architecture  
The system is architected around nodes that register themselves, send periodic heartbeats, and exchange messages through a server that manages behaviour according to the protocol constants. The server component handles incoming connections and distributes messages to registered nodes, while the monitor tracks node health and triggers required actions. The `ProtocolConstants` file encapsulates low‑level magic numbers and message types to keep the implementation clear and configurable.

### Key Components  
| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| `NetworkNode.java` | Represents a participating node in the network infrastructure. |
| `NodeRegistry.java` | Maintains the list of active nodes, registration and deregistration. |
| `NetworkServer.java` | Listens for node connections, processes incoming requests, routes messages. |
| `MessageHandler.java` | Parses message types, deals with business logic according to protocol. |
| `HeartbeatMonitor.java` | Periodically checks node liveness, triggers removal of dead nodes or alerts. |
| `ProtocolConstants.java` | Defines message types, port numbers, heartbeat intervals and other low‑level configuration. |

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Java JDK 11 or higher  
- Maven (or Gradle) for building and dependency management  
- Access to the network environment in which nodes will run  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hypernode‑sol/Network‑and‑Communication‑Infrastructure.git
   cd Network‑and‑Communication‑Infrastructure
   ```  
2. Build the project  
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```  
3. Configure your environment  
   - Edit `ProtocolConstants.java` or supply external configuration (if supported) for ports, intervals  
   - Deploy nodes and the server as separate processes or containers  

## Usage  
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   java ‑jar target/NetworkAndCommunicationInfrastructure‑0.1.0.jar server
   ```  
2. Start one or more nodes:
   ```bash
   java ‑jar target/NetworkAndCommunicationInfrastructure‑0.1.0.jar node ‑serverHost <host> ‑serverPort <port>
   ```  
3. The nodes will register with the server, send heartbeats at configured intervals, and can send/receive messages according to protocol.  
4. To extend the system:
   - Add new message types in `ProtocolConstants.java`  
   - Implement corresponding handlers in `MessageHandler.java`  
   - Extend `HeartbeatMonitor` logic if you require custom health checks
